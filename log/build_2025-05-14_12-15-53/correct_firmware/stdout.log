-- Added test 'cppcheck' to perform static code analysis on C / C++ code
-- Configured cppcheck include dirs: /home/louwee/correct_ws/src/correct_firmware/include;/home/louwee/correct_ws/src/correct_firmware/
-- Configured cppcheck exclude dirs and/or files: 
-- Added test 'flake8' to check Python code syntax and style conventions
-- Added test 'lint_cmake' to check CMake code style
-- Added test 'pep257' to check Python code against some of the docstring style conventions in PEP 257
